In the app you can take a picture by clicing the camera button, then the camera app on your phone opens
After you have taken a photo you are able to add some text that belongs to it. 

When opening the app you can see all of your photos with the correct text, 
it updates everytime you take a new picture and the most recent picture stays at the bottom.

I tried to make it work correctly with you being able to rotate the screen but it wouldn't work so I added a constraint to it.
